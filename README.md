FIXML Case for the TTC 2014
===========================

This case study is a transformation from financial transaction data expressed in FIXML XML format, into class definitions in Java, C# and C++. It is based on an industrial application of MDD in finance, and aims to support rapid upgrading of user software when new or extended FIXML definitions become available. The transformation involves text-to-model, model-to-model and model-to-text subtransformations.
